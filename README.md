For anyone who has noticed, I privated a lot of my repositories recently to avoid overcrowding. Going forward, I want this GitHub account to only contain
projects that I am either working on, or have completed to its fullest, instead of code that I messed around with and never took seriously. My current project is
Zolotel, which will be my E-Commerce store that hopefully in the future I will actually use to buy, sell, and trade electronics as a hobby. My future/side projects 
are listed on my profile's README. 

I will also be looking to contribute to public projects in the near future to show my skills not only as a solo developer but also as a collaborator. My project
needs more instances of contributing to open-source projects, and I look forward to learning from other coders. Stone sharpens stone.

After Zolotel, I started reading books on starting a small business. I hope to use my skills as a software developer to someday start a business and grow in the industry. Realizing very quickly that a lot of work was needed to get to a professional level of coding, I decided to dial back on project-making and start honing my skills with coding by reading textbooks on JavaScript (i.e. Eloquent JavaScript) and going back in my notes from my data algorithms class.

Currently, I feel confident in starting projects again, but there is a decision to be made: exactly *what* it is the project will be. I'm reading online other projects from solo web developers to get some sort of inspiration. 

I dipped my toes into the world of Open Source, and was blown aback by how different it was from what I thought it would be. Seeing all of the different file structures showed me that I still had a lot to learn. I will be spending more time learning how these communities function and how I can contribute.
