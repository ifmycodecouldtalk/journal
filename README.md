For anyone who has noticed, I privated a lot of my repositories recently to avoid overcrowding. Going forward, I want this GitHub account to only contain
projects that I am either working on, or have completed to its fullest, instead of code that I messed around with and never took seriously. My current project is
Zolotel, which will be my E-Commerce store that hopefully in the future I will actually use to buy, sell, and trade electronics as a hobby. My future/side projects 
are listed on my profile's README. 

I will also be looking to contribute to public projects in the near future to show my skills not only as a solo developer but also as a collaborator. My project
needs more instances of contributing to open-source projects, and I look forward to learning from other coders. Stone sharpens stone.
